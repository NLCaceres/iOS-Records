# iOS-Records
Project Currently Titled: Infection Protection.
  iOS App for Healthcare professionals to track important data related to Infection Prevention and Control. 
  Android App as of 2022 has reached feature parity - [Github Link](https://github.com/NLCaceres/Android-Records)
  Next goal for both apps is Charts. Here SwiftUI Charts will shine.

## Future Implementations
  Add data graphs via Swift UI Charts
  Further Report Making Process for enhanced user experience and increased data collection ("Which step did the violation take place?")
  Further Settings Layout 
    - Decide how much normal users can control versus Administration. Can admin control from app or only web?
